## CoQMoE: Co-Designed Quantization and Computation Orchestration for Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformer on FPGA

Below are the implementation codes for our paper, which focuses on the quantization and computation orchestration of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Vision Transformers (ViTs) on FPGA.

The evaluation is coming soon.
